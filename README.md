# Book-Finder-Android-App
Keepsolid summer internship app.

This is my first expirience with Android development :)
In this app we get list of books from google books api, by search key, caching that list in db with Room, also we have history of search made with SharedPreferences. Main Activity made with MVP pattern. Layouts made with fragments.
